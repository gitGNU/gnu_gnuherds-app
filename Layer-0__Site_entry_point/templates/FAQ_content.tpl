<h4>1. {t}Why another Job Site?{/t} <a name="Why_another_Job_Site?"></a> </h4>

	<p>
	{t}Because no one comply the below proposed conditions:{/t}
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li> {t escape='no'
		  1='<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">'
		  2='</a>'
		}Use a license to cover use of the software over a computer network. The current %1Affero GPL%2 license will be upgraded to the GNU AGPL license when it be released. Anyhow, the project is always open to discuss this and any other subject.{/t}

		<li> {t escape='no'
		  1='<a href="/doc/GNUHerds__ER__Logical-model.png">'
		  2='</a>'
		  3='<a href="charter#Committee">'
		  4='<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">'
		}Moreover, the management of the jobsite must be %1controlled by its own users%2 using the democratic policy. That will be guaranteed by the GNU Herds association policy. So, being sure the evolution of the jobsite will be controlled and led by its users.{/t}

		<li> {t}Supplying support to engage among companies and persons, it doesn't matter the which or the order, helping the raise of a diversity of business models.  That is flexibility.{/t}

		<li> {t}Make it easy the contacts among persons and companies interested in Free Software business.{/t}

		<li> {t}Having a global scope, supporting business models based on long-distance jobs. With future technologies the localisation must not be an obstacle to establish relationships about IT services. So, the goal, already got, to translate the webapp to other languages, and to support the fact that a job offer could be inserted in several languages.{/t}
	</ul>

	<p>
	{t escape='no'
	  1='<a href="charter#Aims">'
	  2='</a>'
	}All this taking into account that: "The %1aims%2 of the Association shall be to assist and encourage people in their capacity as Free Software producers."{/t}

<h4>6. {t}e-Voting{/t}<a name="e-Voting"></a> </h4>

	<p>{t}Initially, GNU Herds' members can vote showing their hands, sending an email.{/t}</p>


	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>
	{t}The GNU Herds' official voting mechanism is not intented to:{/t}
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				{t}be used as a country voting system.{/t}
			</li>
			<li>
				{t}be used as the FS community voting system. The FS community does not need a voting system. As Barry Fitzgerald exposes:{/t} <i>"Free Software embodies democracy in an anarchistic, classical democracy kind of way. The freedom of the community is itself the force of democracy"</i>.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<p>
	{t}The GNU Herds' official voting mechanism is only intented to:{/t}
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				{t}be used as voting system to this Association. The voting mechanism must be used as a tool to keep GNU Herds moving in the right direction, helping members guide the board members. It can also be used to get opinions about ideas, etc.: binding vote, opinion vote.{/t}
			</li>
		</ul>

	<p>{t}See references to documentation at bottom of this page.{/t}</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>


	<p>{t}Options{/t}:</p>

	<p>
	{t}There are several projects which try to solve the e-Voting trouble. The goal of each project can be different. Some of them has modified its aims or are stalled:{/t}
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/free/">GNU.FREE</a>: {t}The development has been discontinued due to{/t} <i>"creating an Internet Voting system sufficiently secure, reliable and anonymous is extremely difficult, if not impossible"</i>.
			</li>
			<li><a href="http://glasnost.entrouvert.org">Glasnot</a>. {t escape='no'
			  1='<i>'
			  2='</i>'
			}It seems to support the %1Condorcet method%2 and even "a mix of secret and public ballots".{/t}
			</li>
			<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnuherds-app-dev/2006-12/msg00055.html">demexp</a>
			</li>
			<li>{t}Some free GNU/Linux distributions use it own voting system.{/t}</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ampu/">AMPU</a>. {t}Stalled since March 2002.{/t}</li>

			<li><a href="http://votesystem.sourceforge.net/">Voting Systems Toolbox</a>. {t}It is dormant.{/t}</li>
			<li><a href="http://electionmethods.org/GVI.htm">GVI</a>. {t}It is interested in exploring alternative voting methods.{/t}</li>
			<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/43600/">EVM</a>. {t}It is too young to have released any useful code.{/t}</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.softimp.com.au/evacs/index.html">eVACS</a>. {t}It has already been used in at least one election for the Legislative Assembly in the Australian Capitol Territory in October 2001 and is approved for use in future elections.{/t}</li>
			<li><a href="http://jfreevote.hispalinux.es/">JFreeVote</a>. {t}It is a already implemented, working solution for electronic voting.{/t}</li>

	<p>
	Additionally, we have evaluated or we are evaluating some proposals to be
	used as the GNU Herds e-Voting system. We know some of the below designs
	are poor. Others have been rejected. If you have any comment ...
	{mailto address='association@gnuherds.org'} :
	</p>

	<ol>

		<li>[Central server] &nbsp; <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/free/">GNU.FREE</a> &nbsp; <b>(State:&nbsp;REJECTED&nbsp;?&nbsp;)</b>
			<p><i>Disadventage</i>: Central server. Jose's opinion:
			"The GNU.FREE voting system is not the solution to all
			voting problems any more than any system could be. In
			particular, there is a central point where the
			potential for abuse is great. This is fine (great)
			when this central point can be watched, controlled,
			audited, etc. properly; that is, when the voters have
			near complete trust that the system in not being
			abused or hijacked at this central point. ...".
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			[P2P] &nbsp; Using the 'Peer to Peer network' paradigm instead of the 'Central server' &nbsp; <b>(State:&nbsp;REJECTED&nbsp;)</b>
			<p><i>Goal</i>: Solve the 'central server' disadvantege.</p>
			<p><i>Detailed design</i>: none</p>
			<p><i>Pre-design</i>:
			Using the 'Peer to Peer network' paradigm instead of the 'Central server',
			each member could have a duplication of the voting system.
			All systems in the P2P network get the same member DB, votes, etc. So you can
			not manipulate a system without being noted by the others duplicated 'servers'
			on the network. The voting result have to be the same on all the peers.
			</p>
			<p>
			Any member can connect to the voting system and audit the voting process using
			her system 'copy'.  He can audit the new information (members, votes, ...) which his host is getting from the network.
			</p>

			<p><i>Detailed design</i>: NOT READY YET</p>
