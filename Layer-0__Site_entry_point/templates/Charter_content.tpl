}The Ethics Officer will be appointed by the Free Software Foundation, Inc. to ensure that: %1 %2the integrity of the GNU name is not breached and%3 %2the Association follows the %4Free Software%5 philosophy.%3 %6{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t}The Ethics Officer will suggest ways to maintain those values.  To ensure the Association follows The Free Software philosophy a set of rules will be built. Initially they can be gleaned directly from{/t} <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">The Free Software Definition</a>.
</p>

<p>
{t}The Ethic Officer is a general counsel whose job is to let the group know s/he thinks the Association is investing too much time on something that may jeopardize its status with the FSF.{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t}While the Ethics Officer may choose to actively participate in the committee, it is not his primary duty. All other officers will be elected by the membership.{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t}An Office term will be 4 years.  All committee positions are voluntary, an officer may step down at any time.  After 6 months if the membership is dissatisfied with an officer they may vote her or his out of office.{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t}The goal of the committee is to administer the Association and execute the decisions taken by the members.  Therefore, all decisions will be voted upon by the membership.{/t}
</p>

<p>
{t}In addition to the issues at hand in a vote, the option to abstain, delegate your vote to another individual, and delegate your vote to the committee shall be present.
