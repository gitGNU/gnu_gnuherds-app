}The first step has been to develop the %1Job Site%2 modules and gather together several %3Business Networks%2 models. Some of the JobSite's features are:{/t}</p>

  <li>{t}FS skills data base{/t}</li>
  <li>{t}Telework{/t}</li>

<p>{t}Other modules could be developed. The next steps can be on your side. However, one of those steps has been already proposed: the FSF could grant some certifications. This web application is already ready to support certifications, though such support is now disabled.{/t}</p>
